== Description ==

The Wordpress Signature plugin allows wordpress users to have signatures below every post.This is almost similar to forum signatures where you can have a  default signature on every post you make.The plugin is still being developed and the signature need html formating to appear properly.This means tags like `<br>` before the signature and anchor tags for links.This will be made easier in future versions.

1. Extract and Upload the `wp-signature` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to `Tools >> WpSignature` to  utilize the plugin.
